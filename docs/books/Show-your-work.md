# Intro into the book

This is book about show your work and Author (Austin Kleon) talks about to find yourself!

## Short Summary

Show your work everyday online and it will be helpful to someone and you dont have to be a genius infact the book suggest to be an ameteur to try ,learn and share anything. Be a documentarian to show your process which makes the product whether you are a player , musician. I am a software engineer and I used this mantra to document the books I read and favourite quotes to refer.

This is book for everyone who is afraid to show your work online and afraid of being judged by others whether my work is good enough.

if you are over-thinking like whether to share it or not. The book suggests to take simple flow-chart test "Should I share this" and I would recommend putting the article/video or any other artifact into that test and proceed.
